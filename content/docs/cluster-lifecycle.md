# Cluster lifecycle

These workflows apply to supported OKE clusters managed through Infrayard. Check your cluster tier and network prerequisites before making changes.

## Signing in

Infrayard uses your organisation's existing identity provider (Keycloak, Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace, or any OIDC-compliant IdP). Click **Log In** — you are redirected to your IdP's login page and returned to the portal after authentication. No separate Infrayard account is needed.

## Deploying a cluster

1. Navigate to **Deploy** from the top nav
2. *(Optional)* Select a **Cluster template** — pre-configured profiles created by your admin that pre-fill and lock resource fields (pools, nodes, CPU, RAM, storage). Choose "Custom" to configure everything manually with your account's limits enforced
3. Enter a **Cluster name** — this becomes the base name for all OCI resources (`{name}-cluster`, `{name}-vcn`, etc.)
4. Choose a **CIDR range** from the available pool — each cluster gets its own /24
5. Select a **Kubernetes version**, **VM shape**, and **Node image** (locked if the template defines them; otherwise user-selectable — image defaults to auto-select if none configured)
6. If using "Custom" mode, configure one or more **Node pools** — each pool has a name, node count, OCPU, RAM, and storage, constrained by your account's effective limits
7. *(Optional)* Use the **Advanced tab** to bring existing OCI infrastructure — your own VCN, compartment, or subnet
8. Review the **Deployment Summary** — shows all resources that will be created, plus live estimated monthly and hourly cost
9. Click **Deploy**

Infrayard runs `terraform apply` and streams the live output in the portal. The cluster appears in **My Clusters** once provisioning completes.

> The deploy form enforces your account's effective limits — maximum pools, nodes, OCPU, RAM, and storage. If a limit prevents you from deploying, submit a limit-increase request from the deploy or scale flow; admins can approve granted values into your per-user overrides.

## Scaling a cluster

1. In **My Clusters**, click **Scale** on a running cluster
2. Adjust resources per pool — nodes, OCPU, RAM, and storage
3. Add new node pools or remove existing ones as needed; new pools default their name to the cluster's bare name and accept any name that matches the standard pool-name rules (lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphen, 32 chars max). Existing pool names stay immutable to keep Terraform/OKE state aligned.
4. Review the change preview and click **Apply**

Scaling behaviour depends on the cluster tier configured by your admin — see [Cluster tiers](/docs/cluster-lifecycle/#cluster-tiers).
Kubernetes version changes are handled via a separate **Upgrade** action.

## Destroying a cluster

1. In **My Clusters**, click **Destroy**
2. Infrayard runs `terraform plan -destroy` and shows the exact resources that will be removed
3. Confirm — `terraform destroy` runs and cluster-scoped OCI resources are cleaned up
4. The CIDR range is returned to the pool and available for reuse

Destroy is permanent and cannot be undone.

> **Requests workflow:** The admin **Requests** area handles both protected-cluster destroy approvals and per-user limit-increase requests. Users submit a reason instead of destroying directly or when they need higher limits; admins approve, adjust, or deny with a note. Destroy approval still opens the Terraform destroy plan before force-destroy. Limit approval writes granted values into the user's per-user overrides. Results appear in the user's Activity inbox, and SMTP-enabled installs can also send info-only email pings with requester, action, comments, and request parameters.
>
> **Destroy behavior note:** Infrayard-managed child compartments may be deleted with the cluster. External compartment overrides are retained for shared/multi-cluster setups. In Object Storage, only the destroyed cluster's `.tfstate` object is removed; the user-level prefix/folder is kept for other clusters.

## Activity

The user nav includes an **Activity** inbox with an unread badge. It persists important events across refreshes and sessions; today it records destroy-request approvals/denials, limit request submissions and reviews, TTL expiry warnings at 24h, 4h, and 1h remaining, deploy/scale/upgrade/destroy start and completion events, and admin-driven account limit changes.

## Cluster detail

Click **Details** on any cluster card to see:

- **Cluster information** — name, status, K8s version, region, CIDR, compartment, VM shape, cluster tier, estimated monthly cost, OCID
- **Node pools** — pool name, node count, OCPU, RAM, storage, and status per pool
- **Cost breakdown** — per-pool monthly cost, control plane cost (Enhanced tier), and total with hourly rate
- **Access** — kubeconfig download and SSH key download (see [Kubernetes access](/docs/security/#kubernetes-access))

## Cluster tiers

The admin configures which cluster tier(s) the platform allows: **Basic only**, **Enhanced only**, or **Both**. When a single tier is allowed, users see it as an informational indicator on the deploy form. When **Both** is allowed, the deploy form shows a tier picker so each user picks per cluster — useful when one team wants free/dev clusters and another wants production-grade scaling, all served by the same platform.

| | Basic | Enhanced |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Free | Oracle's current Enhanced control-plane rate |
| Node scaling | ⚠️ Full — add/remove nodes or pools is automatic; resource-profile changes require manual cycling | ✅ Full in-place |
| Cluster Autoscaler | ❌ | ✅ |
| Best for | Dev/test, cost-sensitive teams | Production, automated scaling |

**Basic cluster scaling:** Both Basic and Enhanced clusters support full scaling — nodes, OCPU, RAM, and storage. In Basic clusters, adding/removing nodes or node pools is automatic and does not require manual rotation. Manual cycling is required when changing per-node resources (shape, OCPU, RAM, storage), and is also recommended after a Kubernetes upgrade so workers pick up the new target image/version.

**OKE → Cluster → Node Pool → Nodes → Cordon & drain → Terminate**

Recommended rolling cycle for each affected Basic node pool (current size = `N`):
1. Scale from `N` to `2N`
2. Wait until the additional `N` nodes are `Ready/Active`
3. Scale back from `2N` to `N` (OKE removes extra nodes automatically)
4. Verify workloads and node health before moving to the next pool

The portal shows tier-specific warnings/messages for this flow.

**Kubernetes version upgrades:** Use **Upgrade k8s** on a running cluster. This updates the control plane and node-pool target Kubernetes/image configuration:
- Direct upgrades are limited to the same or next minor version (for example `1.33.x -> 1.34.x`; not `1.33.x -> 1.35.x`).
- Basic: perform rolling worker refresh per pool (`N -> 2N -> N`) after nodes become `Ready/Active`; the Upgrade modal shows live per-pool steps based on current node counts.
- Enhanced: rollout is fully automated (control plane plus worker refresh), no manual cycling required.

**Switching tiers:** Admins can switch the platform tier at any time in Configuration — Basic, Enhanced, or Both. The change applies to all new clusters; existing clusters retain the tier they were provisioned with.

**Per-user tier override:** Admins can pin a specific user to Basic or to Enhanced, regardless of the global setting. The override is force-only (single tier per user); a user without an override inherits whatever the global setting allows, including the per-cluster picker when the global is **Both**.

## Kubernetes upgrades

- **Dedicated action** — available from cluster detail and dashboard actions
- **Shape-aware + allowlist-aware** — upgrade options are filtered to OCI-compatible versions enabled by admin config
- **Sequential minors only** — direct upgrades allow same/next minor only; skip-minor upgrades are blocked with explicit error
- **Control plane + node-pool target update** — upgrade action updates cluster Kubernetes and node-pool target version/image
- **Basic upgrade behavior** — perform rolling worker refresh per pool (`N -> 2N -> N`) after new nodes are `Ready/Active`
- **Enhanced upgrade behavior** — fully automated rollout (control plane + workers), no manual cycling required
- **Tier guidance in UI** — Basic and Enhanced show upgrade-specific notes with rollout guidance
- **Dynamic Basic rollout guidance** — Basic upgrade modal reads live pool/node counts and renders exact per-pool steps (for example `1 -> 2 -> 1` or `3 -> 6 -> 3`) instead of a static example

## Expiry and cleanup

A time-to-live can be set for temporary clusters. When its TTL is reached, Infrayard starts the destroy workflow. Use TTL deliberately and review its interaction with your protected-cluster policy for the supplied release. Activity includes expiry warnings at 24 hours, 4 hours and 1 hour remaining.

Scaling a Basic cluster to zero worker nodes can pause compute use, but does not guarantee a zero Oracle bill: retained resources and other services can still be charged.

Review [operating responsibilities](/docs/operations/) before production changes.
