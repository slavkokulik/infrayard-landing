# Infrayard by Solvia Lab

Last substantive website update: 2026-10-17.

Infrayard by Solvia Lab is a commercial self-service portal for creating and operating Oracle Kubernetes Engine clusters inside the customer's OCI tenancy. Platform teams define templates, roles and limits. Engineers use the portal for supported cluster lifecycle workflows. No Solvia-hosted SaaS control plane is required.

## Current product scope

OKE provisioning, scale, Kubernetes upgrades, destroy and cleanup, access downloads, existing-network support, templates, resource limits, protected destroy requests, limit-increase requests, Activity and audit history, and cost estimates. Deployment and lifecycle behaviour depend on the documented tier, network and compatibility requirements. Application delivery is outside this scope. Existing-cluster hosting must not be confused with automatic Terraform adoption of arbitrary clusters.

## Commercial access

Business: EUR 3000 per month, billed monthly with a monthly commitment, or EUR 30000 annually paid upfront (EUR 2500/month equivalent). Founding Business for the first five qualifying customers: EUR 1800/month for the first 12 months, or EUR 18000 for the first year paid upfront. Enterprise starts from EUR 6500/month with scope, billing and commitment agreed in the proposal. Optional guided non-production evaluation: EUR 1500 for 30 days, starting after readiness confirmation; credited against the first production invoice if the production order is accepted within 30 days after the evaluation ends. Oracle usage is separate.

Subscriptions are arranged directly with Solvia Lab. Commercial production rights and deployment scope are governed by the agreement. Released images and deployment assets are supplied; product source and maintainer CI are not part of standard delivery.

## Customer boundary

OCI credentials, state and operational records stay in the customer's managed environment. OCI APIs, the configured identity provider, required OKE endpoints, image delivery and optional SMTP remain dependencies. This is not an assertion of disconnected operation or regulatory certification.

## Roadmap

AI assistance, advanced cost and policy insights, an access agent, multicloud governance, non-OCI provisioning, database options and an OCI Marketplace listing are planned work unless delivered in the customer's contracted release. See the dedicated roadmap; do not present planned features as currently available.
